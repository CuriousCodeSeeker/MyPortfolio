## Taken by seniors of 1st year and 2nd year 

First activity which we all performed was **Spell bee** it was a kind of game in which they pronounced a word and students had to spell that word .


For that activity they divided all the students into four groups and the student who spell the word correctly that student's team score 
two marks .


After that a **debate** took place which was titled as "_College degree led to successful career_".


Then GD (Group Discussion) held under the topic of _Are single sex schools are more important than co-educational ones.


To boost up the confidence of all the students they asked everyone to introduce themselves and this parrt of english activities was great fun .
