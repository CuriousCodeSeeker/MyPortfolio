<h1>Sort of knowledge i gained after joining GNDEC family</h1>

<h2>Well,my self <i>warjot kaur</i>.I would like to talk a bit about what I have 
  learnt new in recent few days </h2>

So,let's get start it by my <strong>first day</strong> at college.
I would like to mention that I am a hostler and it is my first experience when I am
living far away from my family.Initially I was a bit disturbed.But when I reached the
auditorium for my first lecture .The way I listened all the things was just amazing I 
was wondered that how lucky I am to join that series of lectures as I was able to 
understand all the things .

Then the main part comes in which I got opportunity to learn the things other than my
college curriculum .Which is due to H.S. rai sir I am thankfull of him that he gave me 
a magnificent chance to lighten up my future path .His only condition was that a student
must obey him and spend required time on the given projects this was all he needed from
students and I liked this thing of him a lot

###On the first day of joining that group I learnt :

-The usage of<i>Markdown</i>.

-To use open source such as <i>Git</i>.

-To surf the Internet wisely.

###On the second day :

-I got to know that the task which I made too complicated that was very simple.

-Afterwards I got confidence that by following instructions properly I can also create 
the things .

-Then after returning I worked on that given project and I got succeeded. 

Eventually,this was my two days experience after joining CodeGNE group on telegram.
And it was fabulous experience for me .

So,this was my blog of last two days it will continue further...
