This wass the morning of the new day I was very excited because on this I was going to attend lecture of mathematics 
as mathematics is my favourite subject so I was wondered that what new I would learn that day 
But before that there was peer-interaction conducted by our seniors .
One of them made us familiar with the official website of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College. He illustrated each and every section of website very clearly so that now I am able to understand the structure of College rules and regulations.

**Mathematics class**
It is the main part for me because in that lecture I revised all the formulas regarding calculus and teacher told us to write formulas from home so that in the next lecture we can solve the questions without any difficulty. 

This is how I spent second day of my college....
